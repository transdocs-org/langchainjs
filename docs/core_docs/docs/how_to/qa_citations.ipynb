In December 2016 the results of an extensive survey detailing the distribution and demography of cheetahs throughout the range were published; the researchers recommended listing the cheetah as Endangered on the IUCN Red List.[25]\\nThe cheetah was reintroduced in Malawi in 2017.[160]\\nIn Asia\\nIn 2001, the Iranian government collaborated with the CCF, the IUCN, Panthera Corporation, UNDP and the Wildlife Conservation Society on the Conservation of Asiatic Cheetah Project (CACP) to protect the natural habitat of the Asiatic cheetah and its prey.[161][162] Individuals on the periphery of the prey herd are common targets; vigilant prey which would react quickly on seeing the cheetah are not preferred.[47][60][122]\\nCheetahs are one of the most iconic pursuit predators, hunting primarily throughout the day, sometimes with peaks at dawn and dusk; they tend to avoid larger predators like the primarily nocturnal lion.[66] Cheetahs in the Sahara and Maasai Mara in Kenya hunt after sunset to escape the high temperatures of the day.[123] Cheetahs use their vision to hunt instead of their sense of smell; they keep a lookout for prey from resting sites or low branches. This significantly sharpens the vision and enables the cheetah to swiftly locate prey against the horizon.[61][86] The cheetah is unable to roar due to the presence of a sharp-edged vocal fold within the larynx.[2][87]\\nSpeed and acceleration\\nThe cheetah is the world's fastest land animal.[88][89][90][91][92] Estimates of the maximum speed attained range from 80 to 128 km/h (50 to 80 mph).[60][63] A commonly quoted value is 112 km/h (70 mph), recorded in 1957, but this measurement is disputed.[93] The mouth can not be opened as widely as in other cats given the shorter length of muscles between the jaw and the skull.[60][65] A study suggested that the limited retraction of the cheetah's claws may result from the earlier truncation of the development of the middle phalanx bone in cheetahs.[77]\\nThe cheetah has a total of 30 teeth; the dental formula is 3.1.3.13.1.2.1.\",\n",

In December 2016 the results of an extensive survey detailing the distribution and demography of cheetahs throughout the range were published; the researchers recommended listing the cheetah as Endangered on the IUCN Red List.[25]\\nThe cheetah was reintroduced in Malawi in 2017.[160]\\nIn Asia\\nIn 2001, the Iranian government collaborated with the CCF, the IUCN, Panthera Corporation, UNDP and the Wildlife Conservation Society on the Conservation of Asiatic Cheetah Project (CACP) to protect the natural habitat of the Asiatic cheetah and its prey.[161][162] Individuals on the periphery of the prey herd are common targets; vigilant prey which would react quickly on seeing the cheetah are not preferred.[47][60][122]\\nCheetahs are one of the most iconic pursuit predators, hunting primarily throughout the day, sometimes with peaks at dawn and dusk; they tend to avoid larger predators like the primarily nocturnal lion.[66] Cheetahs in the Sahara and Maasai Mara in Kenya hunt after sunset to escape the high temperatures of the day.[123] Cheetahs use their vision to hunt instead of their sense of smell; they keep a lookout for prey from resting sites or low branches. This significantly sharpens the vision and enables the cheetah to swiftly locate prey against the horizon.[61][86] The cheetah is unable to roar due to the presence of a sharp-edged vocal fold within the larynx.[2][87]\\nSpeed and acceleration\\nThe cheetah is the world's fastest land animal.[88][89][90][91][92] Estimates of the maximum speed attained range from 80 to 128 km/h (50 to 80 mph).[60][63] A commonly quoted value is 112 km/h (70 mph), recorded in 1957, but this measurement is disputed.[93] The mouth can not be opened as widely as in other cats given the shorter length of muscles between the jaw and the skull.[60][65] A study suggested that the limited retraction of the cheetah's claws may result from the earlier truncation of the development of the middle phalanx bone in cheetahs.[77]\\nThe cheetah has a total of 30 teeth; the dental formula is 3.1.3.13.1.2.1.\",\n",
